## Welcome to Sleep-Disorder Respiratory
### About
This is a Mini Project for course code SC1015 (Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence).
Our team's objective is to predict the likelihood of an individual suffering from sleep disorder.

The main source codes can be accessed in the following order:
  1. Data Extraction
  2. Data Visualization
  3. Sleep Disorder Analysis
  4. Stress Analysis

### Problem Definition
Problem Definition: Finding out the reasons that will explain why people have high stress levels and experience sleep disorders. How do different variables affect the stress level and the likelihood of sleep disorders?

Motivation: Many of our peers are experiencing high levels of stress, while struggling with sleep disorders, and they get overwhelmed without knowing how to reduce it. As students, we are highly exposed to stress and to better manage it, it would be beneficial to know the factors that causes it.

### Models Used
Sleep Disorder
  1. Logistic Regression
  2. Random Forest Regression
Stress
  1. 

### Conclusion
- The most important factors that influence the prediction of one being sleep deprived is
  1. BMI 
  2. Blood Pressure
  3. Sleep Duration
